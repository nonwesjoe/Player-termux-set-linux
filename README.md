# Get some preparation first
* get your phone rooted and flash busybox module in magisk.
* in termux, give su and storage permission.
* apt update
* apt install git
* git clone and go into the Directory
# Run run.sh first
* relaunch termux.
* then you get arch installed (run arch to login)
# copy init.sh to /data/local/tmp/arch/
* then login arch and run 'sh /init.sh'
* when it is done run 'pacman -Syu' a few times i think.
